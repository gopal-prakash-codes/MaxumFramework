⭐️ Welcome to Extension | OS

## **Tired of the endless back-and-forth with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools just to repeat the same task over and over?**

You're not alone! I felt the same frustration, so I built a solution: **Extension | OS**—an open-source browser extension that makes AI accessible directly where you need it.

**Imagine**: You create a prompt like "Fix the grammar for this text," right-click, and job done—no more switching tabs, no more wasted time.

> Imagine a world where every user has access to powerful models (LLMs and more) directly within their web browser. By integrating AI into everyday internet browsing, we can revolutionise the way people interact with information online, providing them with instant, intelligent assistance tailored to their needs.

## Pre-release on Google Chrome Store

Join an exclusive group of up to 100 early adopters and be among the first to experience the future of AI-powered browsing!

## Why

On the morning of July 27th, 2024, I began an exciting journey by joining the SF Hackathon x Build Club. After months of refining the concept in my mind, I decided it was time to bring it to life. I worked on enhancing my idea, updating what I had already created, and empowering everyone to unleash their creativity with custom prompts.
